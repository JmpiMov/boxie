A usefull (project for now) compilation of tools, OS and virtualization for pentesting.

<li><b>What is boxie?</b></li>
Too make it simple, boxie is for now a small project letting the user training without damaging the computer. 

<li><b>But... How? What the... Why?</b>
First of all, because. I need a project not to get depressed :p , so let's build something!
  <li>How?</li>
        Pretty simple, an application with 3 tabs. One for documentation, one for PoC & one for testing.
  <li>What the...</li>
        I am making a custom Linux OS from scratch and customizing it to make vulnerable after script activation.
  <li>Why?</li>
        'Cause I am tired of "hacking websites" (some are goods, but others are stupids) and I want a community application entirely customizable with only scripts!

<i><b>For now?</i></b>
</br>

I am making the linux OS. It will be entirely from scratch and with no package manager at the beginning. 
I am thinking of the different scripts that will be available. {SQLi - XPATHi- NOSQLi - XEE}
I will may be add some "crackme" and some forensic challenges. 

Or I will design the app with C++ GTK+ or with Electron, but for now that is sure that the app will be available for <b>Unix (BSD/Linux) & Windows</b>. I will need additionnal time to work on the OSX version because if it's in electron I'll have to add bonus stuff if I want it to work!
